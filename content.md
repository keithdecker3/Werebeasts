You are indeed a Lycanthrope, or Werebeast if you prefer. This does not necessarily have to be a bad thing, as it can be controlled to an extent. All that is required to keep from hurting those around you is to be far away from anyone during a full moon, and if that is not possible, locked up with silver chains or a silver plated cage.

You are not a Lycanthrope. Instead, you are most likely a vampire or some other form of blood sucker. As this is not something that we have information available on this site, we ask that you please visit our affiliate website, www.vampyr.com, to get more information on what you can do to help with this condition.

You are not a Lycanthrope, and are most likely very mentally ill. Please seek immediate mental help from a psychiatrist or other mental health physician. We here at were.com are not licensed to help diagnose your obvious issues.

## Answers 4

You are not a Lycanthrope. In fact, you have no reason to really even be here. As far as we can tell, you came here just to goof off and answer random questions. Do you need more things to do in your life? I highly recommend finding yourself some other way to get your rocks off. Maybe a significant other, or perhaps a hobby of some sort. Please do not come back to this site unless you are actually worried about being turned into some supernatural creature. Thank you.

## Classes of Werebeast

## Werebear
Werebear's are rather distinct in appearance, even when not transformed. Most of the time, the body begins to swell and put on more muscle mass. Excessive body hair is also a general side effect. Being a Werebear usually is not a terrible thing, as most are able to control their actions rather well. Tend to be isolationist, and make a concerted effort not to infect others with their curse. Very rarely they will form a bond with someone else and turn them, staying with them to help through the transition and gain control of their new form. Tend to be one of the most docile as far as beasts of the Were variety. Hair color tends to match the shade of whatever Ursine turned them. All Werebeasts have 3 forms they can take. Human, beast, and a hybrid. Speech is impossible in beast form, though simple speech is possible when in a hybrid state.

## Wereboar
Wereboar's are ill tempered and vulgar brutes. Tend to be stocky and muscular, with short, stiff hair in human form. Most Wereboar's are violent by nature, and thrill in the attacking of other people. Indiscriminately do they spread their curse, knowing that the more someone fights the curse, the more savage and bestial they will become in the end. They tend to live in small family groups well away from society. Generally suspicious by nature, they tend to stick to themselves while in human form, but relish the carnage of an attack while transformed. All Werebeasts have 3 forms they can take. Human, beast, and a hybrid. Speech is impossible in beast form, though simple speech is possible when in a hybrid state.

## Wererat
Wererat's tend to be sly and cunning creatures. A frame that is usually wiry and twitchy, with thin hair and darting eyes. Most Wererat's tend to live beneath heavily populated urban centers, forming criminal organizations in the sewers and alleys of many cities. They very rarely will turn someone with their curse, only when they wish to induct someone into their criminal organization. Any accidental infection or those that attempt to flee from the organization, are ruthlessly hunted down and killed in order to keep their nefarious activities secret. All Werebeasts have 3 forms they can take. Human, beast, and a hybrid. Speech is impossible in beast form, though simple speech is possible when in a hybrid state.

## Weretiger
Weretiger's are ferocious individuals, with haughty and fastidious natures. Tending to be of a lithe and sleek muscular build in human form, they also tend to be rather tall and very meticulously groomed. Very territorial when it comes to other Werebeasts, especially other Weretiger's, they tend not to give pass on their curse to others as it just means more competition for territory and prey. They tend to isolate themselves in far flung areas, especially wooded and jungle environs. They will occasionally come to a small village or town in order to trade things or revel. In rare circumstances, they may live as a small family of two to three individuals, though more often than not, they are loners. All Werebeasts have 3 forms they can take. Human, beast, and a hybrid. Speech is impossible in beast form, though simple speech is possible when in a hybrid state.

## Werewolf
Werewolves are savage predators. No real physical changes at a glance after they are turned when in humanoid form, though they do have heightened senses, fiery tempers, and tend to eat rare meat. Most people afflicted with Lycanthropy tend to flee any civilized areas, in a bid to try and save their loved ones from what they have become. Those that embrace their curse, tend to flee as to not risk discovery. Most Werewolves tend to form packs with each other out in the wilds, and even with normal wolves on several occasions. All Werebeasts have 3 forms they can take. Human, beast, and a hybrid. Speech is impossible in beast form, though simple speech is possible when in a hybrid state.
