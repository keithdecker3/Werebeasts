                    <br>
                    <p>You are indeed a Lycanthrope, or Werebeast if you prefer. This does not necessarily have to be a bad thing, as it can be controlled to an extent. All that is required to keep from hurting those around you is to be far away from anyone
                        during a full moon, and if that is not possible, locked up with silver chains or a silver plated cage. To find out more on what kind of Werebeast you might be, please visit our

                    <br>
                    <p>You are not a Lycanthrope. Instead, you are most likely a vampire or some other form of blood sucker. As this is not something that we have information available on this site, we ask that you please visit our affiliate website, www.vampyr.com,
                        to get more information on what you can do to help with this condition.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>You are not a Lycanthrope, and are most likely very mentally ill. Please seek immediate mental help from a psychiatrist or other mental health physician. We here at were.com are not licensed to help diagnose your obvious issues.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>You are not a Lycanthrope. In fact, you have no reason to really even be here. As far as we can tell, you came here just to goof off and answer random questions. Do you need more things to do in your life? I highly recommend finding
                        yourself some other way to get your rocks off. Maybe a significant other, or perhaps a hobby of some sort. Please do not come back to this site unless you are actually worried about being turned into some supernatural creature.
                        Thank you.</p>
